This Workshop aims at exploiting the laboratory-based learning methodology (or practical education methodology) for Mechatronics and Robotics. 

The Japanese education focuses on practical needs of society, as such, many courses are developed in Laboratory-based and Project-Based Learning. This benefits Japanese universitiesâ€™ graduates to join industry with practical skills, favoring sustainable competitiveness. 

Implementing practical education in Egyptian universities is challenging due to differences in culture, context, and educational system. This seminar gives the opportunity for Egyptian Faculty Members, Researchers and Students to explore and exploit the Japanese practical education.

The title is "3rd Egypt-Japan Workshop on Practical Education for Mechatronics and Robotics", which is a succession of the two versions held Alexandria (March 2014) and Tokyo (March 2017).
