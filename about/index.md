This Workshop aims at exploiting the Laboratory-Based learning methodology (or Practical Education methodology) for Mechatronics and Robotics. 


The Japanese educational system focuses on practical needs, hands-on and creativity-nurtuing approaches, as such, many courses are developed in Laboratory-Based and Project-Based Learning. This benefits Japanese universitiesâ€™ graduates to join industry with practical skills, favoring sustainable competitiveness.


Implementing Practical Education in Egyptian universities is challenging due to differences in culture, context, and educational system. This seminar gives the opportunity for Egyptian Faculty Members, Researchers and Students to explore and exploit Japanese practical education approaches.


The title is "3rd Egypt-Japan Workshop on Practical Education for Mechatronics and Robotics", which is a succession of the two previous versions: in Alexandria (March 2014) and in Tokyo (March 2017).
