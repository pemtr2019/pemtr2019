This Workshop focuses on practical approaches in Higher Education for Mechatronics and Robotics.


The Japanese educational system focuses on practical needs, hands-on and creativity-nurturing approaches. As such, many courses are developed in Laboratory-Based and Project-Based Learning. This approach benefits Japanese universitiesâ€™ graduates to join industry with practical skills, favouring sustainable competitiveness.


This seminar gives the opportunity for Egyptian Faculty Members, Researchers and Students to explore and exploit Japanese practical education approaches in Mechatronics and Robotics fields. The title is *3rd Egypt-Japan Workshop on Practical Education for Mechatronics and Robotics*, and is a succession of the two successful previous versions: in Alexandria (March 2014) and in Tokyo (March 2017).
