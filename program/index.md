## Speakers

#### [Prof. Sugano Shigeki](http://www.sugano.mech.waseda.ac.jp/) (Waseda University, Japan)
##### Dean, School / Graduate School of Creative Science and Engineering <br>  Professor, Department of Modern Mechanical Engineering.
##### 11:00 - 12:00
> Title: Robot and AI  -Embodiment Informatics-

Robot is a System Integration Technology. Most of the elements of robots are based on the fundamental Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. It is called “Embodiment Informatics”. Recently, Embodiment Informatics includes AI technologies so that it has made rapid progress. In this presentation, I will introduce the concept of Embodiment Informatics, Waseda robots with their history and key-technologies, recent progress of AI-implementation in the robots, and an example of Nursing-Care Robots development.

#### Prof. Mohamed Fanni (E-JUST, Egypt)
##### Chairperson of Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering Department <br> Professor, Department of Mechatronics and Robotics
##### 12:00 - 13:00
> Title: Development of Innovative Mechatronic Systems from Idea to Prototype

The presentation introduces the recent research activities that are carried out at Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering Department. The presentation focuses on illustrating how an innovative idea is processed to end up with working prototype. The presentation outlines some mechatronic projects such as aerial-ground robot manipulation system, inspection climbing robot, new industrial robot, parallel surgical robot, wearable vehicle, insect killing robot, flapping wing air vehicle with jumping mechanism, piezoelectrical morphing wing air vehicle, synthesis of a hybrid brain for a humanoid robot, wind turbine with hybrid  magnetic bearing, and robot with multiple contactless joints. All these projects start with proposing some conceptual designs. After preliminary analysis, the most promising concept is selected for detailed design. Finite element analysis is carried out to check the strength and rigidity of the design. Dynamic modeling of the system is made and the controller is designed. Dynamic simulation is carried out using professional software to check the controller and the dynamic performance of the system. The actuators, sensors, and electronic interfaces are selected. A prototype is then manufactured and tested.

#### [Prof. Miyashita Tomoyuki](http://www.miyashita.mmech.waseda.ac.jp/) (Waseda University, Japan)
##### Professor, Department of Modern Mechanical Engineering
##### 14:00 - 15:00

> Title: Machine and Human - Interface and Control

The (machine's) dynamical behavior is often governed by a control mechanism and user commands from an interface. In this seminar, I will introduce a number of researches aiming to improve machine performance and user sensation within the context of vehicles and drones. Also, the design of vehicle seats considering the driver's behaviour will be introduced, and the stability of drone performance against disturbances by Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG) and user controller will also be introduced.

#### Eng. Ahmed Saad (Unilever, Egypt)
##### Manufacturing Excellence Manager
##### 15:00 - 15:30
> Title: World Class Manufacturing

What is World Class Manufacturing? 
World Class Manufacturing (WCM) is a structured and integrated production system that involves all site’s processes and the entire organization from top to shop floor people. WCM's target is to continuously improve site’s performance eliminating waste & losses. WCM's ambition are (1) “Zero Gaps” - Growing skills and Capability, (2) Zero Accident & First Aid, (3) Zero quality defects & customer claims, (4) Zero machine breakdown, (5) Zero waste & losses.

#### Prof. Adel Rayan (Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology)
##### Dean of Faculty of International Business and Humanities (FIBH).
##### 15:30 - 16:00
> Title: Managing Innovation at the University: Business aspects of Innovation

The subject title of this talk is about how innovative ideas are developed to be a final product. The role of creativity in innovation, the innovation process and the innovation stakeholders. The role of the university and industry in supporting and commercializing innovations.
